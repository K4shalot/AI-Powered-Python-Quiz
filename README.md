# Python Interview AI Quiz

This is an educational web application built with Django, designed to help users prepare for technical interviews in Python. The project features two types of quizzes: a classic multiple-choice quiz and an innovative AI-powered quiz where users can type their answers in natural language. These answers are then evaluated for correctness by the Google Gemini API.

Additionally, the AI quiz supports features like AI-generated hints and detailed mistake explanations, turning it into an interactive learning tool.

## Key Features

*   **Classic Quiz:** A standard multiple-choice quiz with instant feedback.
*   **AI Quiz:** Evaluation of free-text answers using the Google Gemini API.
*   **AI Hints:** The ability to request a hint for a question, generated by the AI.
*   **AI Mistake Explanations:** A detailed breakdown of why an answer was incorrect, provided by an AI mentor.
*   **Dynamic Interface:** Utilizes AJAX to load hints and explanations asynchronously without a full page reload.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Django
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash`)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd python-interview-project
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one with this command: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

An API key is required to interact with the Google Gemini API.

1.  **Get your API Key:**
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Sign in with your Google account.
    *   Click "Get API key" -> "Create API key in new project".
    *   Copy the generated key. *(Note: As of August 2025, this service has a generous free tier).*

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    *   In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
    *   Add your API key to it in the following format:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_COPIED_API_KEY"
    ```

### 6. Apply Database Migrations

Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

You are now ready to run the project!
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Populating the Database with Questions

Congratulations on successfully setting up the project! Now, let's add some questions.

The questions for the quiz are loaded from a JSON file using the provided `script.py`.

### 1. Prepare Your JSON File

The script expects a JSON file containing a list of question objects. Each object must have the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.",
      "b": "Tuples are faster for iteration.",
      "c": "Lists can only store items of the same type."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "answer": null
  }
]
```
**Warning:** The script will fail if the JSON objects do not match this structure.

### 2. Update and Run the Script

1.  Place your JSON file (e.g., `my_questions.json`) in the project's root directory.
2.  Open the `script.py` file.
3.  Find the line: `with open('file_name.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:`
4.  Change `'file_name.txt'` to the name of your JSON file.
5.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```
    You should see a success message in the terminal once the questions have been processed and added to the database.

### 3. Start the Quiz!

After the script finishes, run the Django server again:
```bash
python manage.py runserver```
That's it! Your quiz is now populated with questions. Good luck!
