Python Interview AI Quiz
This is an educational web application built with Django, designed to help users prepare for technical interviews in Python. The project features two types of quizzes: a classic multiple-choice quiz and an innovative AI-powered quiz where users can type their answers in natural language, which are then evaluated for correctness by the Google Gemini API.
Additionally, the AI quiz supports features like AI-generated hints and detailed mistake explanations, turning it into an interactive learning tool.
Key Features
Classic Quiz: A standard multiple-choice quiz with instant feedback.
AI Quiz: Evaluation of free-text answers using the Google Gemini API.
AI Hints: The ability to request a hint for a question, generated by the AI.
AI Mistake Explanations: A detailed breakdown of why an answer was incorrect, provided by an AI mentor.
Dynamic Interface: Utilizes AJAX to load hints and explanations asynchronously without a full page reload.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Django
AI: Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
Database: SQLite (for development)
Setup and Installation

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
Git

2. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/K4shalot/AI-Powered-Python-Quiz.git
cd python-interview-project  # Navigate into the project directory

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

# Create a virtual environment
`python -m venv venv`

# Activate it
# On Windows
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
# On macOS / Linux / Bash
`source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, you can create one with this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt)

5. Configure Environment Variables
An API key is required to interact with the Google Gemini API.
Get your API Key:
Go to Google AI Studio.
Sign in with your Google account.
Click "Get API key" -> "Create API key in new project".
(Totaly free by 14.08.2025)
Copy the generated key.
Create a .env file:
In the root directory of the project, create a new file named .env.
Add your API key to it in the following format:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_COPIED_API_KEY"

6. Apply Database Migrations
Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

`python manage.py migrate`

7. Run the Development Server
You are now ready to run the project!

python manage.py runserver
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


So you manage to succesfully setup this somehow working project, congrats!
Whats next? Where is the questions? What should i do?
Basicly you probably saw fiel with name `script.py`
This is the brain of this program. To have these all questions and answers you need a json file with questions and answers and correct answers. Basicly it should be like this:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Populating the Database with Questions
Congratulations on successfully setting up the project! Now, let's add some questions.
The questions for the quiz are loaded from a JSON file using the provided script.py.

1. Prepare Your JSON File
The script expects a JSON file containing a list of question objects. Each object must have the following structure:

[
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.",
      "b": "Tuples are faster for iteration.",
      "c": "Lists can only store items of the same type."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "answer": null
  }
]
Warning: The script will fail if the JSON objects do not match this structure.

2. Update and Run the Script
Place your JSON file (e.g., my_questions.json) in the project's root directory.
Open the script.py file.
Find the line: with open('file_name.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
Change 'file_name.txt' to the name of your JSON file.
Run the script from your terminal:

python script.py
You should see a success message in the terminal once the questions have been processed and added to the database.

3. Start the Quiz!
After the script finishes, run the Django server again:

python manage.py runserver
That's it! Your quiz is now populated with questions. Good luck!
